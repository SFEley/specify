<h2>What is <a href="../../../../classes/FixtureReplacement.html">FixtureReplacement</a></h2>
<p>
<a
href="../../../../classes/FixtureReplacement.html">FixtureReplacement</a>
is a <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> plugin that provides a
simple way to quickly populate your test database with model objects
without having to manage multiple, brittle fixture files. You can easily
set up complex object graphs (with models which reference other models) and
add new objects on the fly.
</p>
<p>
Not only can <a
href="../../../../classes/FixtureReplacement.html">FixtureReplacement</a>
make your test data easier to maintain, it can also help to make your tests
and specs much more readable and intention-revealing by allowing you to
omit extraneous details and focus only on the attributes that are important
for a particular behaviour. It works well with both <a
href="http://rspec.rubyforge.org/">RSpec</a> and <a
href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/test/unit/rdoc/classes/Test/Unit.html">Test::Unit</a>.
</p>
<h3>What&#8216;s new in Version 2:</h3>
<p>
(Skip this section if you are new to fixture replacement)
</p>
<p>
The format of the db/example_data.rb file is much more flexible. Now
namespacing is taken care of, and even custom fixtures can be created. Here
are some examples:
</p>
<pre>
  module FixtureReplacement

    # using Namespacing
    attributes_for :credit_card, :class =&gt; Payment::CreditCard do |cc|
      cc.user = default_user
      cc.card_number = &quot;5555-5555-5555-5555&quot;
    end

    attributes_for :user do |u|
      email = random_email

      u.username = random_username
      u.password = &quot;my-pass&quot;
      u.password_confirmation = &quot;my-pass&quot;
      u.education_level = default_education_level
      u.gender = &quot;male&quot;
      u.email_address = email
      u.email_address_confirmation = email
      u.date_of_birth = Time.mktime('1985', '06', '12')
    end

    # Here is the custom fixture.  The :from inherits
    # all the attributes from the user specified above,
    # but specific attributes can be overriden as needed.
    # This is especially helpful in script/console in development
    # mode, when you need to login to your site.
    #
    # This will generate the methods create_scott, and new_scott,
    # which can be passed hashes, as usual
    attributes_for :scott, :from =&gt; :user do |u|
      u.username = &quot;scott&quot;
      u.password = &quot;scott&quot;
      u.password_confirmation = &quot;scott&quot;
    end

    # And here is an STI example.  Notice the :class needs
    # to be specified, as well as the :from key, which will
    # inherit the attributes.

    attributes_for :item do |i|
      i.user = default_user
      i.category = default_category
      i.title = &quot;Test Title #{String.random}&quot;
      i.description = String.random
      i.text = &quot;Item Text #{String.random}&quot;
    end

    attributes_for :writing, :from =&gt; :item, :class =&gt; Writing
</pre>
<p>
Since all of this is in one file, editing it shouldn&#8216;t be a big task.
Also, the create_*, new_* and default_* methods are still in place and
function in the same manner as they did before, so none of your tests
should need to change.
</p>
<p>
Another note: If you are running <a
href="../../../../classes/FixtureReplacement.html">FixtureReplacement</a>
on externals, you&#8216;ll want to remove the old repository link (<a
href="http://thmadb.com/public_svn/plugins/fixture_replacement">thmadb.com/public_svn/plugins/fixture_replacement</a>/),
and switch to the new one (<a
href="http://thmadb.com/public_svn/plugins/fixture_replacement2">thmadb.com/public_svn/plugins/fixture_replacement2</a>/).
</p>
<p>
Version 1 still works, and you are welcome to use it, but no new
development will occur with it. The old docs are still <a
href="http://fixture_replacement.rubyforge.org/version_one/">around</a>
</p>
<h2>How to use <a href="../../../../classes/FixtureReplacement.html">FixtureReplacement</a></h2>
<h3>Defining default attributes</h3>
<p>
At the heart of <a
href="../../../../classes/FixtureReplacement.html">FixtureReplacement</a>
is the <tt>db/example_data.rb</tt> file where you define the default
attributes for each of your test models. This example shows the default
attributes for a user:
</p>
<pre>
  module FixtureReplacement

    attributes_for :user do |u|
      password = String.random

      u.value                  = &quot;a value&quot;,
      u.other                  = &quot;other value&quot;,
      u.another                = String.random,     # random string 10 characters long
      u.one_more               = String.random(15), # 15 characters long
      u.password               = password,
      u.password_confirmation  = password,
      u.associated_object      = default_bar        # expects attributes_for :bar to be setup
    end

  end
</pre>
<p>
Note that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>a <a href="../../../../classes/String.html#M000001">String.random</a>
method is provided for attributes whose exact value isn&#8216;t important;
this means you can create multiple, unique model instances

</li>
<li>you can perform arbitrary set-up and execute any Ruby code prior to
returning the hash (as shown here where a <tt>password</tt> is generated
and then used for both the <tt>:password</tt> and
<tt>:password_confirmation</tt> attributes)

</li>
<li>a <tt>default_modelname</tt> method is automatically provided that allows
you to set up dependent model objects (in this case an instance of the
<tt>Bar</tt> model)

</li>
</ul>
<p>
A small generator is included to start setting up the db/example_data.rb
file. Run:
</p>
<pre>
  ./script/generate fixture_replacement
</pre>
<h3>Available methods</h3>
<p>
Based on the above definition <a
href="../../../../classes/FixtureReplacement.html">FixtureReplacement</a>
makes the following methods available:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../../classes/String.html#M000001">String.random</a>:
generates a random string as shown above

</li>
<li><tt>new_user</tt>: equivalent to <tt>User.new</tt> with the attributes for
the user.

</li>
<li><tt>create_user</tt>: equivalent to <tt>User.create!</tt> with the
user&#8216;s attributes.

</li>
<li><tt>default_user</tt>: for use inside <tt>model_attributes</tt>
definitions; this basically returns a <tt>Proc</tt> object which allows the
actual creation of the object to be deferred until it is actually needed:
in this way unnecessary object creation is avoided until it is known for
sure that a particular attribute is not going to be overridden.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overriding attributes</h3>
<p>
Overrides of specific attributes can be performed as follows:
</p>
<pre>
  new_user(:thing =&gt; &quot;overridden&quot;)
  create_user(:thing =&gt; &quot;overridden&quot;)
</pre>
<p>
Overrides can also be used with associations:
</p>
<pre>
  scott = create_user(:username =&gt; &quot;scott&quot;)
  post = create_post(:user =&gt; scott)
</pre>
<h3>attr_protected / attr_accessible</h3>
<p>
In the case that the model has an attr_protected field, <a
href="../../../../classes/FixtureReplacement.html">FixtureReplacement</a>
will assign the field as if it wasn&#8216;t protected, which is convenient
for testing:
</p>
<pre>
  class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    attr_protected :admin_status
  end

  user = create_user(:username =&gt; &quot;scott&quot;, :admin_status =&gt; true)
  user.admin_status # =&gt; true
</pre>
<h2>Motivation Behind <a href="../../../../classes/FixtureReplacement.html">FixtureReplacement</a></h2>
<p>
As Dan Manges has outlined in his blog post, &quot;Fixing Fixtures with
Factory&quot; (<a
href="http://www.dcmanges.com/blog/38">www.dcmanges.com/blog/38</a>), this
approach to generating test data has a number of advantages:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The factory provides default values and relationships

</li>
<li>Invalid data will never be loaded into your test database, as it is with
the typical YAML fixture. A record which is created with a create_* method
(create_user, create_post, etc.) uses ActiveRecord&#8216;s create! behind
the scenes, so any invalid data will raise a clear error. This means that
you will spend your time debugging your tests and code, not your test data.

</li>
<li>It&#8216;s in Ruby, so you won&#8216;t have to fight with YAML&#8216;s
spacing issues, plus the data is by nature more dynamic and more agile.

</li>
<li>When a test fails (and they will), someone who hasn&#8216;t written the
test will be able to figure out the <b>intention</b> behind the test. They
won&#8216;t have to go digging through YAML files to figure out the
relevant data to the test.

</li>
<li>No more opening of 5 different YAML files to see the associations and
column names of different models - this is conveniently located in one file
(db/example_data.rb)

</li>
<li>If you set use_transactional_fixtures = true in your test_helper or
spec_helper (and you <b>really</b> should be using this), the data that is
created in each test will be rolled back, meaning no-side effects, and a
consistent database among different developers, and for your self during
different test runs.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Random Data in db/example_data.rb</h3>
<p>
The use of random data should also be spoken of. Many may think this to be
dangerous, but in fact random data is often helpful. Consider the following
snippets of psudo-code (along with it&#8216;s test):
</p>
<pre>
  # apps/models/user.rb :
  # ----------------------

  class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    validates_uniqueness_of :username
    validates_presence_of :password

    after_create :check_password

  private

    def check_password
      # ...
    end

  public

    def establish_friendship_with(other_user)
      # ...
    end

    def friends
      # ...
    end
  end

  # The test:
  # ---------

  def test_make_sure_user_can_establish_friendship
    @user_one = User.create({
      :username =&gt; &quot;foo&quot;,
      :password =&gt; &quot;some password&quot;,
      :password_confirmation =&gt; &quot;some password_confirmation&quot;
    })
    @user_two = User.create({
      :username =&gt; &quot;bar&quot;,
      :password =&gt; &quot;some password&quot;,
      :password_confirmation =&gt; &quot;some password confirmation&quot;
    })

    @user_one.establish_friendship_with(@user_two)
    @user_one.friends.should == [@user_two]
  end
</pre>
<p>
Notice that the above test adds a lot of extra noise in getting valid users
into the database; The test, however, doesn&#8216;t care what the usernames
are, that the password is a good one, that the password matches the
password confirmation, and so on. The point of the test is not to check
those things, but rather that a friendship can be established.
</p>
<p>
Here would be a similar test with the <a
href="../../../../classes/FixtureReplacement.html">FixtureReplacement</a>:
</p>
<pre>
  # The test:
  # ---------

  before :each do
    @user_one = create_user
    @user_two = create_user
  end

  def test_make_sure_user_can_establish_friendship
    @user_one.establish_friendship_with(@user_two)
    @user_one.friends.should == [@user_two]
  end
</pre>
<p>
Once again, the test above doesn&#8216;t care about usernames, so why
should you? But to even store those two users into the database, you will
need unique usernames, as well as password which match. Here is where the
random data comes in:
</p>
<pre>
  # db/example_data.rb
  # -------------------

  module FixtureReplacement

    attributes_for :user do |u|
      password = String.random

      u.username =&gt; String.random,
      u.password =&gt; password,
      u.password_confirmation =&gt; password
    end

  end
</pre>
<p>
Now, in a different test case, if you do care about the usernames not being
random, it is easy to set them:
</p>
<pre>
  create_user({
    :username =&gt; &quot;scott&quot;,
    :password =&gt; &quot;foobar&quot;,
    :password_confirmation =&gt; &quot;foobar&quot;
  })
</pre>
<h3>Disadvantages of <a href="../../../../classes/FixtureReplacement.html">FixtureReplacement</a></h3>
<p>
The one major disadvantage behind this approach is that it&#8216;s slow -
just as slow as fixtures, if not slower. One approach that the rspec crowd
is using is to use this plugin in integration tests, while using mocks
&amp; stubs in model unit tests. It&#8216;s not a big deal if your
integration tests run slow, since you probably don&#8216;t run them very
often.
</p>
<p>
Another approach is to look to external sources to speed up your test
suite:
</p>
<ul>
<li>a sqlite3 in-memory database (can cut your test/spec time in half)

</li>
<li>unit-record gem (by Dan Manges), which takes advantage of multi-core
processors

</li>
<li>a distributed build system, such as spec_distributed

</li>
<li>running tests individually, or per file

</li>
<li>A faster machine

</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you have other ideas for speeding up your test suite, I&#8216;m all
ears.
</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<pre>
  ruby script/plugin install http://thmadb.com/public_svn/plugins/fixture_replacement2/
</pre>
<p>
Or use externals:
</p>
<pre>
  ruby script/plugin install -x http://thmadb.com/public_svn/plugins/fixture_replacement2/
</pre>
<p>
Run the generator if you don&#8216;t have the file
<tt>db/example_data.rb</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
  ruby script/generate fixture_replacement
</pre>
<h3>Using <a href="../../../../classes/FixtureReplacement.html">FixtureReplacement</a> within <tt>script/console</tt></h3>
<pre>
  % script/console
  &gt;&gt; include FixtureReplacement
</pre>
<h3>Using it with RSpec</h3>
<p>
Add the following to your <tt>spec/spec_helper.rb</tt> file, in the
configuration section:
</p>
<p>
Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
</p>
<pre>
  config.include FixtureReplacement
</pre>
<p>
end
</p>
<h3>Using it with Test::Unit</h3>
<p>
Add the following to your <tt>test/test_helper.rb</tt> file:
</p>
<p>
class Test::Unit::TestCase
</p>
<pre>
  include FixtureReplacement
</pre>
<p>
end
</p>
<h2>Running the Specs/Tests for <a href="../../../../classes/FixtureReplacement.html">FixtureReplacement</a></h2>
<p>
You will need rspec (version 1.0.8 or later) to run the specs, as well as
the sqlite3-ruby gem (and sqlite3 installed):
</p>
<pre>
  % sudo gem install rspec
  % sudo gem install sqlite3-ruby
</pre>
<p>
cd into the fixture_replacement plugin directory:
</p>
<pre>
  % cd vendor/plugins/fixture_replacement
</pre>
<p>
Then run with &lt;tt&gt;rake&lt;tt&gt;
</p>
<pre>
  % rake
</pre>
<p>
There are also some tests for test/unit. These mainly serve as regressions,
but you are free to run them as well.
